# EE660_Project
Machine Learning Project

This contains the documents (Data files and MATLAB codes) I used for my project:



1) The Pre_Processing folder contans the raw data as obtained from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#



2) The Pre-Processing folder contains the code used to process the raw data and extract additional features.



3) The FULL_DATASET_AFTER_PREPROCESSING_AND_EXTRACTION contains the following features: (Morning), (Afternoon), (Evening), (Weekday), (Weekend), (Hot Season), (Cold Season), (Voltage), (Global Intensity), (Sub-Metering 1), (Sub-Metering 2), (Sub-Metering 3), (Unmetered Power), (Total Power Consumed), (Metered Power > Unmetered). Power. 



4) The Linear regression folder contains the code and dataset set I used for training and evaluating the model. I sed the fitCv function from the PMTK tool to take care of the cross validation. I also used some other functions from the PMTK tool. The result of the model was saved in the "txt" file.



5) The Logistic regression folder contains the dataset for the model. I also used some PMTK funtions together with the code I uploaded in this folder. The folder also contains the result of the model saved in a "txt" file.



6)  The K-Means Clustering folder contains the dataset I used for clustering and the result of the clustering The result contains the mean of the clusters and the Calinski and Harabasz index (CH(K)).
